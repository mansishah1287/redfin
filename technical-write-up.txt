Summary of the web application: A single page application that can provide available food truck open at the current time with Name and address.

Architecture of the web application:
1) A client UI where user can see list of available food truck.
2) A server that make an call to api and return results to the client.
3) Cache the results so that when any other user or same user request the same, instead of making call, 
    just send the results. It will help in performance of the site.

To establish this flow:
1) We need to organize our files into folders.
2) Try to have clear separation of concern.
3) Make sure to have business logic and api routes in a different files.
4) Think of reusability while designing. Modularity and Composition are the key parts of designing.
5) Include unit testing and maximize the code coverage rate.
6) Add proper logs to the application.
7) Monitor the front-end and backend application using different tools to manage performance of the site.

The folder structure can be:
application
   config
   src
   	- containers
   	- components
   	- servers
   	- app.js
   	- routes
   	- service
